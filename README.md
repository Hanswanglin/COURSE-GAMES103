> This course is an introduction to physics-based computer animation techniques, focusing on a variety of basic physical animation simulation techniques. The course covers four main directions: 
>
> 1) rigid body simulation, 
> 2) mass spring, constraint and cloth simulation,
> 3) elastomer simulation based on finitens,
> 4) fluid simulation.

The course mainly use the unity3D as the implementation platform.
